# What you need to know about this project

I want to modify this template so it can be easily integrated in Rmarkdown (via a latex template). I will try to provide many code comments and perhaps some documentation. I warn anyone who tries to use this that I am not a developer so I don't guarentee that this will work for your documents.

# RoadMap

  - initial integration with Rmarkdown **(In-progress)**
  - make abstract optional
  - allow user to replace the greybox with an image of their choice



# Original OUP information

This is OUP's new document class file for typesetting journal articles,
"oup-authoring-template.cls".

oup-authoring-template.cls is based upon the standard LaTeX document class
article.cls. It uses natbib.sty for bibliographical references.

The file manifest.txt provides a list of the files in the oup-authoring-template
bundle.  The following are the main files available:
- oup-authoring-template.tex, Sample template file to start with a new article
- oup-authoring-template.pdf, Sample pdf using the option contemporary, large layout. Please modify the options appropriately in the tex file to get different layouts. 
- oup-authoring-template.cls is the class file 

The documentation file for the original template is oup-authoring-template-doc.tex in the doc directory.  To
compile it:
latex oup-authoring-template-doc.tex

Also, oup-authoring-template-doc.pdf is available in the doc directory.
